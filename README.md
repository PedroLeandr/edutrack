EduTrack is a lightweight platform that helps teachers monitor students efficiently by transforming basic academic data into actionable insights.

No bureaucracy. No spreadsheets. Just clarity.

## 🚩 The Problem

Teachers already do the hard work:
- Teaching classes
- Correcting exams
- Supporting students

But on top of that, they must:
- Track attendance manually  
- Manage grades across tools  
- Identify struggling students too late  
- Write repetitive reports  

The result: **late interventions and wasted time**.

---

## 💡 The Idea

EduTrack solves this by asking teachers to do **only the basics**:
- Mark attendance  
- Insert grades  
- Add short observations  

From there, the system:
- Analyzes performance automatically  
- Flags students at risk  
- Generates ready-to-use reports  

This is **not about replacing teachers** — it’s about helping them act earlier.
